1. Create a struct named `Person` with three fields: `FirstName` and `LastName`
   of type string and `Age` of type int. Write a function called `MakePerson`
   that takes in `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` and returns a `Person`.
   Write a second function `MakePersonPointer` that takes in `firstName`,
   `lastName`, and age and returns a `*Person`. Call both from main. Compile
   your program with `go build -gcflags="-m"`. This both compiles your code and
   prints out which values escape to the heap. Are you surprised about what
   escapes?

2. Write two functions. The `UpdateSlice` function takes in a `[]string` and a
   string. It sets the last position in the passed-in slice to the passed-in
   string. At the end of `UpdateSlice`, print the slice after making the change.
   The `GrowSlice` function also takes in a `[]string` and a string. It appends
   the string onto the slice. At the end of `GrowSlice`, print the slice after
   making the change. Call these functions from main. Print out the slice before
   each function is called and after each function is called. Do you understand
   why some changes are visible in main and why some changes are not?

3. Write a program that builds a []Person with 10,000,000 entries (they could
   all be the same names and ages). See how long it takes to run. Change the
   value of `GOGC` and see how that affects the time it takes for the program to
   complete. Set the environment variable `GODEBUG=gctrace=1` to see when
   garbage collections happen and see how changing `GOGC` changes the number of
   garbage collections. What happens if you create the slice with a capacity of
   10,000,000?
